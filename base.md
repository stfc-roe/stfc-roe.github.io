# Base Raiding


## Prevention

### Best Strategy - Shield

- Shields or Share
- Enough free shields for 24/7 coverage by complete dailies.

### Getting Shields

- 4, 8 and 12 hours shields everyday by completing dailies
- 1 Day / 3 Day / 7 Day shields in alliance store

## Defense

### Apply a shield before Auto Bubble expires in 10 minutes

### 

## Alliance Support

### Send coords to AC when you see base raiding against alliance members

### However, we may fail. In which case, we will help the member cracking another base to recover.

### We DO NOT avenge base raid since it is fair game.


## Basics

### Base raiding is NOT roe violation.
