## Rules of Engagement (ROE)

Rules of Engagement (ROE) are rules agreed upon by players in a STFC server. They might be slightly different than in other servers, but these are ours to date. You can also refer to this guide, which is fairly close (if not basically the same) to our ROE: https://www.pvptarget.com/guide#roe

1. No hitting mining ships that are Under Protected Cargo (UPC). They must be Over Protected Cargo (OPC). 
2. Warships (including the North Star) are fair game if they're mining.
3. No hitting allies or friendlies (purple heart üíú or purple vulcan saluteüññ in game)

‚õèÔ∏è You can hit miners UPC **only if** their ship is sitting on a "zero node" (the node says 0 resources left) are fair game. Message them first and give them a 1 minute warning!

üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Warships are fair game, and hitting one doesn't violate ROE, but don't be a jerk about it, e.g. no camping out at mission points. 

‚öôÔ∏è Hitting ships in ~~augment space or~~ systems that require a token to get there is not allowed (this becomes an issue at later levels)

*If you're into PVP, targeting OPC miners is the way to go. It doesn't violate ROE, doesn't piss off other alliances, and you can get some decent resources out of it.*

**How to tell if someone is UPC or OPC:**
- "Scan" their ship. 
- A "rewards" box will appear in the bottom middle of the screen. 
- If there are resources showing (e.g. dilithium, ore, etc), they're OPC! You can see how much by clicking on the box. If you only see a chest/cargo, do not attack.

**Retaliation:**
Some players out there ignore these rules. It's annoying AF. But all retaliation must follow ROE. So if someone hits you outside of ROE, you're welcome to take out their warship or OPC miner in turn, but not their UPC miner.

**Enemies**
Enemies may be marked as "enemy" in game (red target beside their name). 

_**Please follow ROE when attacking enemy alliances.**_

Exceptions: players that are "Kill on Sight" (KOS) by the entire server (ie Erek) & players marked "enemy" in an alliance of one.

### Friendlies and Allies

Friendlies and Allies: They don't attack our ships and bases, and we don't attack theirs.

Allies: They *may* request assistance, and we *may* or may *not* provide it. Any requests for assistance will first go through alliance leadership.

Do not intervene in any raids or attacks etc of an allied or friendly alliance (beyond pm'ing their admiral/comms, if you wish). If you feel the situation may require it, please confer with alliance leadership. Thanks all!

## Armada and Take over

### Common Protocol on joining Armadas
- Everyone is welcome to join any Armada
- Most Armadas will be auto sorted base on ship strength
- Members Lv23+ that need to build their ACC will take priority so we have more players capable of hosting Armada.
- Armada is NOT first come, first serve. When joining Armada, please be prepared you may not make it for any reasons.
- If for any reason you want to be in Armada (like haven't done one in days) please reach out to the host.
